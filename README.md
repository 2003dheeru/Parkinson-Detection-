Machine Learning Model Development:

Implemented a Random Forest Classifier for detecting Parkinson's disease using a dataset of medical features, achieving an accuracy of X% (replace X with your model's accuracy).
Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:

Performed feature selection and scaling on a dataset of Parkinson's disease patients, ensuring optimal performance of machine learning models.
Handled missing data and performed feature normalization using MinMaxScaler to scale data in the range of -1 to 1.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to ensure the robustness of predictions.
Conducted train-test split with a 20% test size to validate model performance.
ython and Data Science Libraries:

Utilized Python and libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, model training, and visualization.
Automation and Prediction:

Developed a script for automated prediction of Parkinson's disease based on user input, allowing for real-time disease detection.
